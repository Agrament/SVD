# Image Reconstruction using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) 
## Singular Value Decomposition aka SVD is one of many matrix decomposition Technique that decomposes a matrix into 3 sub-matrices namely U, S, V where U is the left eigenvector, S is a diagonal matrix of singular values and V is called the right eigenvector. We can reconstruct SVD of an image by using linalg.svd() method of NumPy module
